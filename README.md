This is a Next.js project that has been bootstrapped with create-next-app.
    
## Getting Started

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

You can begin editing the page by modifying the `pages/index.js` file. The page will automatically update as you make changes.

API routes can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). The endpoint for this route can be found in the `pages/api/hello.js` file.

The `pages/api` directory is treated as API routes instead of React pages and is mapped to `/api/*`.
